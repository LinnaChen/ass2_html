         <p>Python has continued its upward trajectory from last year and jumped two places to the No. 1 slot, though the top four - Python, C, Java, and C++ - all remain very close in popularity. Indeed, in Diakopoulos&#8217;s analysis of what the underlying metrics have to say about the languages currently in demand by recruiting companies, C comes out ahead of Python by a good margin.
         </p>
         <p>So, our group would like to introduce the top four languages to you. </p>

            <p>IEEE Spectrum is the flagship magazine and website of the IEEE, the world&#8217;s largest professional organization devoted to engineering and the applied sciences. Our charter is to keep over 400,000 members informed about major trends and developments in technology, engineering, and science. Our blogs, podcasts, news and features stories, videos and interactive infographics engage our visitors with clear explanations about emerging concepts and developments with details they can&#8217;t get elsewhere.

        <div align="center"><p><strong>About The Rank </strong></p></div>
            <p>Unlike other programming language surveys, the IEEE Programming Language Survey gives you the ability to interactively alter the weights on the ranking criteria. Applying 12 metrics to 10 data sources, they rank 48 languages. They also explain their design, methods, and data sources.
            </p>
            <p>Several preset rankings are given: for a typical reader of the IEEE Spectrum, emerging trends, employer interest, and open source. You can also filter based on industry sector: web, mobile, enterprise, or embedded. You can compare the results to a previous year. Changing the weights on the various data sources allows changing how much importance you want to give them. One of the survey's data sources is the IEEE Xplore Digital Library of conference and     journal articles about scientific and engineering.
            </p>
            <p>The IEEE survey is more flexible than other language surveys.  This survey does not offer a statistically valid representation of current use. It tries to relate language discussion (Stack Overflow) with use (GitHub) in an effort to extract insights about potential future adoption trends.
